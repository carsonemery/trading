This item identifies the symbol associated with trading of a particular issue on an exchange.

This field is blank for issues trading on exchanges where this concept is not applicable.

Not all issues have a Trading Symbol.

A parent-company ticker is followed by a number (i.e. EGN1 for Alabama Gas Corp) indicates a subsidiary of a publicly traded company.

Companies

Ticker symbol conventions are described in the following table:

Ticker Type

Generic Example

Explanation

Canadian Securities - Non-conventional Voting

ABC.LV

ABC.MV

ABC.NV

ABC.RV

ABC.SV

In September 2004, the TSX introduced ticker suffixes for securities with non-conventional voting structures. The five suffixes are as follows:

.LV Limited Voting Shares

.MV Multiple Voting Shares

.NV Non-Voting Shares

.RV Restricted Voting Shares

.SV Subordinate Voting Shares

Canadian delisted

ABC.Z

Issue delisted by the TSX or TSX Venture Exchange. Less frequently, the .Z may indicate a company that has been delisted from a U.S. exchange after being acquired.

Canadian Unit

(Inactive)

ABC.U

For a Canadian Unit (a group of shares) the ticker symbol is followed by a (.U). For example:

Acclaim Energy Trust AE.U

Canadian Unit

(Active)

ABC.UN

For a Canadian Unit (a group of shares) the ticker symbol is followed by a (.UN). For example:

Acclaim Energy Trust AE.UN

Note: Effective June 2011 all active Canadian tickers that were in the ABC.U format have been converted to ABC.UN.

CNQ listing

ABC.H

Indicates a company listed on the CNQ, the Canadian stock exchange for securities of emerging companies.

Delisted Companies

ABC.Z

When a security has been delisted by the TSX or TSX-V exchanges, a (.Z) is appended to the ticker symbol. The (.Z) is used less frequently for U.S. exchanges to indicate that the company has been delisted, often after being acquired.

Duplicate Active/Inactive Companies

ABC

ABC.

ABC.1

Active and inactive (research) companies may have duplicate ticker symbols. In this case, the active company will carry the ticker symbol obtained from the S&P Stock Guide or the NASDAQ system, and the inactive company will have a period (.) at the end of the ticker symbol. For example:

Dime Community Bancshares (active) DCOM

Dicomed Corp. (research) DCOM.

Note: When multiple research companies have the same original ticker symbol, a .1 is added to the end of the ticker symbol of the company most recently added.

Duplicate U.S./Canadian ticker symbols

A

A.

U.S. and Canadian companies may share the same ticker symbol. To avoid duplication of ticker symbols, we add a period (.) at the end of all Canadian ticker symbols. For example:

Barnes Group Inc. (U.S. company) B

BCE Inc. (Canadian company) B.

Emerging Market Companies on NYSEAmex

ABC.EC

Emerging market companies that trade on the NYSE American and were allowed to meet lower listing requirements than other companies were assigned ticker symbols ending with (.EC). For example:

Encore Marketing Int'l Inc. EMI.EC

Note: This is no longer required nor reported by the NYSE American.

Leveraged Buyouts

1234C

Special tickers are assigned to companies that have undergone leveraged buyouts but continue to file reports. The special tickers consist of four digits followed by a (C). For example:

Formica Corp. 6061C

Parisian Inc. 6055C

NASDAQ Fifth Character

ABCDA

ABCDK

All security symbols on the NASDAQ Exchanges are either four or five letters long. A fifth letter indicates a subordinate issue class.

Fifth letter A = Class A shares

Fifth letter K = nonvoting shares

A list of current fifth characters and their descriptions can be found here.


Note: Beginning in January 2014, the NASDAQ Stock Market ® (NASDAQ ®) is expanding its symbology for NASDAQ-listed companies. NASDAQ is allowing a symbol with multiple classes of stocks to be differentiated with a delimiter: the delimiter ( €œ. €) is used to separate the suffix from the root symbology.

Example

A NASDAQ primary listed issue with a symbol of ZXYX can issue a class B security and choose between the class B security having ZXYX.B or ZXYXB as their class B issue.
A NASDAQ primary listed issue with a symbol of ZXY could issue a class B security and choose between the class B security having ZXY.B or ZXYB as their class B issue.
NASDAQ and OTCBB late filing

ABCDE

When a company files its 10-K or 10-Q late, a fifth character "E" suffix is added to the ticker symbol. The suffix may be removed when the company files again or when it is moved an OTHOTC listing.

NASDAQ New Issues

ABCDD

A fifth character of "D" represents a new issue (i.e. a new CUSIP was assigned to an issue) and is often used in conjunction with reorganizations and reverse splits. This is a temporary suffix.

NASDAQ When Issued and When Distributed

ABCDV

A fifth character of "V" represents "when issued" or "when distributed" trading. This is a temporary suffix and is removed from the ticker when the company begins or resumes regular-way trading. This is often used for recently spun off companies, which trade with the "V" temporarily appended to their ticker symbol until regular-way trading begins.

NEX listing

ABC.H

Indicates shares traded on the NEX (a separate board of the TSX Venture Exchange). (See also CNQ).

Non-trading companies with trading divisions

ABXY.CM

Special tickers are assigned to non-trading companies whose financials represent consolidated statements of two other divisions that actively trade and file separate financial reports. Special tickers consist of four characters; two characters are from one division's ticker symbol and two characters are from the other division's ticker symbol. The ticker is followed by (.CM). For example:

Unilever Combined UNUL.CM

Unilever N V - NY Shares UN

Unilever PLC - Amer Shares UL

Non-trading Issues - Private or Debt-Only

1234B

Pseudo-ticker symbols are assigned to private companies, companies that issue debt only, co-ops, limited partnerships and red herring companies that have not yet applied for a ticker symbol. These special tickers consist of four digits followed by a (B).For example:

Science Applications Intl. CP 1134B

Agway Inc. 1900B

Nontrading Issues - Wholly-Owned Subsidiary (non-public companies)

1234A

A pseudo-ticker symbol is assigned to subsidiaries of companies with no publicly traded common stock. These special tickers consist of four numbers followed by an (A). For example:

National Rural Utility Coop CP 2381A

Tennessee Valley Authority 3015A

NYSE, ASE

ABC.A

ABC.B

The S&P Stock Guide lists ticker symbols for companies that trade a particular class of stock on the New York Stock Exchange or NYSE American Stock Exchange. These tickers are followed by a period (.), and an alpha character identifying the class of stock. For example:

American Maize Products - CL A AZE.A

Brown-Forman - CL B BF.B

NYSE rights issue

ABC.R

OTC Bulletin Board

3ABC

Securities listed on the OTC Bulletin Board (exchange code 13) are assigned a prefix of '3.'

Example: Allstar Inns 3ALST

Pre-Amendment

ABC.N

ABC.M

Pre-amendment data is comprised of an amended company's fundamental financial data prior to restatement. When a company restates one or more years of fundamental financial data, we represent the company's pre-amendment data separately and assigns a pseudo-ticker symbol that is comprised of the company's true ticker symbol and a .M or .N suffix to the company's pre-amendment record.

Networks Assoc. - Pre Amend NET.N

Preferred Shares

ABC.P

Preferred issues typically have suffixes .PA, .PB, .PC, etc. (Note that structured products can also have these suffixes). Preferred issues on the TSX can also have suffixes of .PR.A, .PR.B, .PR.C, etc.

Pro Forma

ABC.P

When a major merger occurs for entities in the S&P 1500, a Pro Forma entity is created in the database. The Pro Forma company name ends in (-pro forma) and the ticker ends with a .P (first pro forma issue) or .R (second pro forma issue). We continue to collect data for both entities as well as the "pro forma merged entity". When the transaction is completed, both the non-survivor and the Pro Forma entities are inactivated.

SFAS #94

ABC.F

Upon introduction of SFAS #94, many companies presented both pre- and post-SFAS #94 data. We assign special tickers to companies that present current data that is consistent with historical data. These tickers are followed by a (.F). For example:

Ford Motor Co. (post-FASB #94) F

Ford Motor Co. (pre-FASB #94) F.F

Structured Products

ABC

ABC.P

Structured Products can have suffixes .PA, .PB, .PC, etc. (Note that preferred shares can also have these suffixes.)

"When Issued" Trading

ABC.WI

ABCDV

For NYSE American, NYSEArca, and NYSE listed companies: When a company is trading on a "when issued" basis prior to an IPO, a (.WI) is appended to the ticker symbol. Once a company has gone public, the (.WI) is removed from the ticker symbol.

A fifth character of "V" represents "when issued" trading. This is a temporary suffix and is removed from the ticker when the company begins or resumes regular-way trading. This is often used for recently spun off companies, which trade with the "V" temporarily appended to their ticker symbol until regular-way trading begins.

Wholly-Owned Subsidiary (publicly traded companies)

Pn

Wholly-owned subsidiaries are assigned pseudo-tickers. Some pseudo-tickers are four-digit numbers followed by an "A" and others are parent-company's ticker symbols followed by a number. All are assigned an exchange code of 5 (Other). The special ticker is (Pn) where P is the parent company's ticker symbol and n is a unique number identifying a particular subsidiary of that parent.

Four-digit tickers followed by an "A", such as 9626A for Allstate Life Insurance CO/NY, are subsidiaries of private companies. Parent company's ticker symbols followed by a number, such as EGN1 for Alabama Gas Corp., are subsidiaries of publicly traded companies.

Indexes This item identifies the unique trading symbol assigned to every index in Xpressfeed. Index trading symbols are comprised of the following elements from left to right:

Index Ticker Flag

This element flags the ticker as a ticker representing an index. Tickers representing Canadian indexes start with "CI'. All others start with "I".

Region Code

1 = Africa & Middle East

2 = Asia & Pacific

3 = Europe

4 = Latin America & Caribbean

5 = North America

6 = World-Wide

Note: Tickers representing Islamic indexes that focus on the United States and Canada may contain this element.

ISO Country Code

For indexes from outside the U.S. and Canada that focus on a specific country, this element is the country's 3-character ISO Country Code. For indexes published outside the U.S. and Canada that focus on more than one country, this element will be "UNK" for unknown.

Note: Tickers representing Islamic indexes that focus on the United States and Canada may contain this element.

Numeric Component

For U.S. and Canadian indexes, this is a 4-digit number. For indexes from outside the U.S. and Canada, this is a 3-digit number.

Note: For tickers representing Islamic indexes that focus on the United States and Canada, this element may be 3-digit number.
